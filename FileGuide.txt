Description:  This is the file guide for my template project.
              Use the "tree" command in terminal for the project folder and copy it here.
              Below the tree, list each element (folders and files) of the tree in the order they appears in the tree.
              Place an indented description beneath each of these elements.
              
*Place Tree Here*
