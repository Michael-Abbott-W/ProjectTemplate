Description:  This is the file guide for my template project.
              A ">" denotes a folder, and everything in that folder will be indented under it.
              A "-" denotes a file. For both files and folders, descriptions are placed directly underneath, also indented
              
>ProjectTemplate
  -README.txt
  -FileGuide.txt
  >NotTracked
    This folder is where I will keep all material that I don't want to track with github.
    This may include large data files or sensitive materials.
    IE this folder will always be empty except for some files with instructions on how to fill it
    -AddNotTrackedMaterial.txt
      Explains how to fill this folder with the necessary materials.
